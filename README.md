# rosalind_shared_DNA_motif
Finds the longest common substring shared by a list of DNA sequences.

This program was my first attempt to solve the Finding a Shared Motif on Rosalind.

It works fine on small lists of short DNA sequences but could not return an answer for the Rosalind question dataset within 15 minutes.

See the Solution branch for code that can return a correct response within 5 seconds.
